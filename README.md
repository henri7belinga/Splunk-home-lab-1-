<h1>Analyzing DNS Log Files Using Splunk SIEM</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I leveraged Splunk Enterprise to conduct a comprehensive analysis of DNS logs. The process began by uploading a compressed DNS log file into Splunk, followed by an efficient triage to prioritize critical events. I performed advanced field extraction to isolate key data points and utilized Splunk’s search and reporting capabilities to identify anomalies and potential threats. Through this analysis, I was able to highlight top DNS sources, investigate suspicious domains, and uncover patterns indicative of malicious activity. The project showcased my skills in field extraction, threat detection, and actionable intelligence generation using Splunk’s robust data analytics platform.
